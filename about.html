                        <p>
                            Shakti Milan Samaj (SMS) is an apolitical, non-profit organization based in Kathmandu, Nepal
                            started
                            by three HIV positive women who were trafficked and rescued in 1996, came together with a
                            common
                            mission to support and work for the empowerment of the trafficked HIV infected women and
                            their
                            children infected and affected by HIV. This independent group was formed in 2003 and was
                            legally
                            registered as an independent NGO in 2006 addressing the urgent need of an institution that
                            could
                            support and provide holistic services to the trafficked HIV infected women and their
                            children who
                            are deprived of their fundamental needs from the society. Since then the organization has
                            grown in
                            providing holistic services and support not only to the trafficked HIV infected women
                            survivors, but
                            to the HIV infected mothers and their children and the vulnerable groups.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            SMS believes in achieving success through collective effort and association, and therefore
                            SMS has
                            long been associated with the network working against human trafficking and on the issues of
                            People
                            Living with HIV/AIDS. A founder member and an Executive Director of SMS also served as a
                            president
                            of NAP+N, a network on the issues of HIV and a network called Alliance against Trafficking
                            in Women
                            and Children in Nepal (AATWIN). Nepalese society considers HIV positive women as sinful and
                            impure
                            to live in the society. They are reluctant of the fact that anyone can be HIV infected and
                            HIV
                            infection is widespread in every class and case of society/community. The conditions are
                            much worse
                            for women because of the patriarchal mindset who blames women who are responsible and
                            condemns her
                            even if she is infected by her own husband. Shakti Milan Samaj thrives to provide these
                            women a
                            platform to speak up for their rights and fight for their dignity and respect. It thrives to
                            create
                            an environment for the HIV infected women and children where they will not be accepted by
                            the
                            society with pity but as an important member.

                        <h3>SMS's Vision</h3>
                        <p>
                            A just society where the rights of all individuals are respected, protected, and fulfilled
                            particularly the rights of women and children. SMS envisions a Nepalese society where people
                            are not
                            discriminated based on their socio-economic and health status and all have opportunities to
                            live a
                            healthy and prosperous life, for example the life of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA).
